confirmEmail form field\nCreate a custom validator that ensures they are the same value\nDisplay an error message if the fields do not match\n\nExtra\n\nCan you make the validator more general to compare any two fields, and not have the field names hardcoded?\nHow would you make the error name configurable also?\n\nCustom Validators\n\nWhen applied at the field level, get access to the FieldControl.\nWhen applied at the group level, get access to the FieldGroup.\nValidators return null if they are valid.\nValidators return an object with validation details if they are in valid.\nYou can create functions that return a validator if you want to apply a configuration.\n\nExample from the Validators.maxsource\nfunction max(max: number): ValidatorFn {\n  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {\n    if (isEmptyInputValue(control.value) || isEmptyInputValue(max)) {\n      return null; // don't validate empty values to allow optional controls\n    }\n    const value = parseFloat(control.value);\n    // Controls with NaN values after parsing should be treated as not having a\n    // maximum, per the HTML forms spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-input-max\n    return !isNaN(value) && value > max ? { max: { max: max, actual: control.value } } : null;\n  };\n}note : the top level key in the object that you return, is what the error will be called, and you can check if a field / form has an error using\nfb.hasError('max');\nfb.get('someField').hasError('max)Displaying Errors\n\n  First Name is a required field.\nYou can also use *ngIf/as to get the underlying error object:\n\n  Minimum value is {{ min.min }}, got {{ min.actual }} instead\nServices / DI\nRequirements\n\nCreate a ProfileData service in the ProfileModule\nCreate an Interface under app/models to describe the shape of the profile\nURL: https://rio-ng-training.now.sh/profile\nGET\nPUT\nPOST\n\n\nUse service to populate correct name in app header\nUse service to populate profile edit form\nUpdate form to submit details to API\n\nexample json response:\n {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"image\": \"profile-image.jpg\",\n    \"languageId\": 1,\n    \"firstName\": \"Evan\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Schultz\",\n    \"averageNumberOfHoursPerDay\": 3,\n    \"email\": \"evan@rangle.io\"\n  },ng g service profile/services/profile-dataExtra\n\nWhen you save the form - check what response comes back from the server\nAre there any extra properties we don't want, and why?\nHow can we protect against this?\n\nNgRx / Shared State\nWe now have a bit of a problem - we want to have the profile name display in the header, and be\nreflected when we update the profile.\nRight now this state isn't being stored anywhere.\nRequirements\n\nSetup NgRx Store for profile\nCreate reducer for managing profile state\nCreate Effect for calling the API\nUpdate the Navigation Header to read name from state\nUpdate Edit Form to get details from state\n\nNgRx Setup with CLI\nng add @ngrx/store --statePath store/reducers\nng add @ngrx/effects  --m app.module.ts --group=true --flat=true\nng add @ngrx/store-devtools\nsetup a profile edit page\n\nng g component profile/components/profile-edit --flat=true --m=profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
